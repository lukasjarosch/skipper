      # We might need to rethink how to include classes in the first place
      # Maybe using a namespace means that all keys are added to this class dynamically.
      # That way the replacing would be even more consistent.
      # 
      # We need to be careful if this class is then used by another (or the tharget)
      # to make sure that the changes are reflected.
      # This is because the class would then have the path `sandbox.azure.storage_account`
      # but it should actually be `azure.storage_account` since that's the namespace which was modified.
