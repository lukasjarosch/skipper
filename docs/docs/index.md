## What is Skipper?

Whoa, TODO

## The problem

## Our solution

## What Skipper is *not*

- A solution to all your problems, but it might just solve a few :wink:
- A 'one-size-fits-all' project which allows you to think of something else.
    - Sorry to tell you that, but you will need to have to put some effort into solving your problems.
    - **But**, it's great to be able to solve problems the way *you* think they should be solved.  
        Without having to solve basic stuff (that's what Skipper does).
- It won't cook dinner or bring you a beer. We'll inform you once we've figured that out, tho.

## I've seen this before...
Skipper is heavily inspired by the awesome [Kapitan](https://kapitan.dev/) project.  
The major difference is that skipper is meant to be used as library. This allows you for example to have way more
control over the data-structures used inside the templates. 

Additionaly we think that being able to provide a single binary without any dependencies will make thinks a lot easier.  
This is what you can do with Skipper. Build *your own* templating sytem, which is nice.

Skipper is not meant to be a *one-size-fits-all* solution.   
The goal of Skipper is to enable companies to create the own - custom built - template and inventory engine, without having to do the heavy lifing.
