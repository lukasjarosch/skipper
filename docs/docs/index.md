## What is Skipper?

Whoa, TODO

## I've seen this before...
Skipper is heavily inspired by the awesome [Kapitan](https://kapitan.dev/) project. The major difference
is that skipper is primarily meant to be used as library. This allows you for example to have way more
control over the data-structures used inside the templates. 

Skipper is not meant to be a *one-size-fits-all* solution. The goal of Skipper is to enable
companies to create the own - custom built - template and inventory engine, without having to do the heavy lifing.
